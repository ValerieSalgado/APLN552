## How Code-Switching and Cognates Affect Surprisal In Language Models 

This project looks at how a simple English-trained language model handles bilingual sentences, especially those with code-switching and cognates. The model was tested on English-only and mixed English-Spanish sentences to see how surprisal changes. This helps show how language models react when they see words from a different language.

## Main Research Question:  
**Research Question: How does code-switching and using cognates affect a language modelâ€™s ability to predict the next word?**

## Hypothesis:
**A model trained only on English will have higher surprisal when reading Spanish sentences, even if the words are cognates. Code-switching will make prediction harder.** 

## Further Information
The results and data are included in this project. You can find surprisal scores for both English and Spanish sentences, along with the code used to calculate them. All the data files, scripts, and graphs are organized in the folders provided.
